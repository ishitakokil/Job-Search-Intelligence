The base model with agentic control provides the most precise and informative results, while the fine-tuned model offers clean summaries but can sometimes overgeneralize. The effectiveness of the agent-based architecture becomes especially evident when the task demands structured extraction or constraint satisfaction, reinforcing the value of system orchestration in RAG pipelines."

    "- The base LLM provided generic responses with little grounding in real data. While it offered reasonable guesses based on prior knowledge, the answers were often vague, outdated, or inaccurate — for example, listing high-profile companies hiring for AI roles without citing real listings. This made the base model suitable only for brainstorming or general awareness, not reliable insights.\n",

However, it lacked the ability to prioritize or filter results meaningfully.

It demonstrated that while retrieval alone enhances accuracy, it needs additional reasoning for refinement.\n",

It combined retrieval with coordination between agents (query rewriting, document grading, answer generation, verification), leading to more accurate and context-aware outputs. It captured key constraints (such as excluding Java), offered well-structured summaries with salary and location details, and surfaced companies actually present in the dataset. This version struck the best balance between specificity, accuracy, and completeness.\n",

Its standout feature was the ability to generate well-summarized responses, often including helpful salary or level overviews. However, it sometimes abstracted too far and lost critical information like job titles, company names, or constraints explicitly stated in the question. This suggests the fine-tuning was skewed toward general summaries and lacked sufficient examples involving filtering or constraint-based reasoning.\n"
